Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Devendra, a Software Developer with a strong interest in Open-Source tech.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve worked with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) and other EVM-Compatible blockchain. 

ðŸ¥‡ I have contributed to some of the big projects in Web3 space like [Ava labs](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-docs/graphs/contributors), [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon), [ENS](https://github.com/ensdomains/address-encoder/graphs/contributors), 
[Bancor Network](https://github.com/bancorprotocol/sdk/graphs/contributors) etc.

Research:
- [Can NFTs be used to assign open source IP license?](https://www.councilpost.net/data-integrity/blockchain/devendra/nft-based-open-source-licensing-2/)
- [NFTs as a medium of IP valuation of open source technologies.](https://www.councilpost.net/data-integrity/blockchain/devendra/nft-based-licence-of-oss/)
